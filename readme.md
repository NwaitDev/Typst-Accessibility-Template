# A Typst template for accessible content

This repository was born from a debate I had with a friend about wether to use MS Word or LaTeX to produce pdf documents.
Among all the arguments he talked to me about, the the most valuable one that I heard was the one on the accessibility of the documents.

Apparently, "What better than LaTeX to not produce an accessible document?" Unreadable, Old fashioned, lame...

I wanted to prove him wrong, so I decided I would write a template to easily generate accessible documents. And since that guy managed to get me interested into this Typst thing, I also wanted to give it a try at the same time.
